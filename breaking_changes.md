# Information

This document contains information about breaking changes if a new version is released and the configuration changed.
If you use the homeassistant image please also follow the snapcast and satellite breaking changes.

# Versions
## From unstable to v1.0.0
I released the first stable version from piCompose. There is still some things todo but i think this release can be marked as a first stable and working version.

## From v1.0.4 to v1.0.5
Switched from wyoming-satellite to linux-voice-assistant. This is a breaking change because the configuration and software changed.
