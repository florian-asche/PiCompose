PiCompose - Docker Compose Manager

Create subdirectories here for your Docker Compose projects.
Each subdirectory should contain at least a docker-compose.yml file and a picompose.conf configuration file.

Example:
    /compose/my-project/docker-compose.yml
    /compose/my-project/picompose.conf

For a specific Example see the example directory!
